# CpHMetaD_Tutorial

## Aim

This tutorial aims to train users to perform CpH-Metadynamics simulations using the stochastic titration constant-pH Molecular Dynamics method and PLUMED. 

## Objectives

Upon completion of this tutorial users will be able to:
- Write and modify both the CpHMD.settings and PLUMED input file to perform CpH-MetaD simulations ;
- Calculate free energy as a function of the chosen collective variables and the pH of the simulation ;
- Unbias conformational and pH-dependent properties ; 
- Estimate the errors in average protonations and pKa estimates ;
- How to combine multiple CpH-MetaD simulations through binless WHAM procedure ;
- Calculate properties using the WHAM pH weights.

## Software Installation

We will need PLUMED 2.9.0, a GROMACS version 2023 patched with PLUMED and the CpHMD v3.0 for this tutorial. The first two softwares can be installed using the instructions found [here](https://github.com/plumed/cecam2023/blob/main/software.md). For the installation of the CpHMD v3.0, we recommend visiting the [GitHub page](https://github.com/NunoFBOliveira/CpHMD_v3/tree/main) of the CpHMD method by the Machuqueiro group and installing the AMBER version. Following that installation, visit the [CpH-Metadynamics page](https://github.com/Tomfersil/CpH-MetaD/tree/main) by TomÃ¡s F. D. Silva and follow the instructions on how to patch the CpHMD v3.0 for modified AMBER $\chi$ OL3 RNA parameters and the metadynamics compatibility using PLUMED. Please follow nad cite the relevant papers mentioned in the GitHub pages. 

## Resources

This tutorial contains the following files:
- .occ files: a type of file that contains protonation data;
- .pdb/.xtc: a reference pdb file and the trajectories necessary for the analysis;
- HILLS:  files that contain the accumulated bias for each pH simulation; 
- .dat: PLUMED input and output files required for analyses in the notebook.

Additionally, several scripts are available for preparation of trajectories and protonation files, to generate PLUMED input files and to obtain their respective output data.

## Introduction to CpH-Metadynamics

Constant pH Metadynamics is a methodological approach that integrates two main ideas: the [stochastic titration Constant pH Molecular Dynamics](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1497164) method and the [metadynamics](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42254-020-0153-0) method. For a more detailed explanation of how both these methods work, we recommend a deeper dive into the provided links. However, here we will tackle the main rationale behind the [CpH-Metadynamics approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16064) and to do that we will tackle the st-CpHMD first.

### st-CpHMD:

The [st-CpHMD method](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1497164) and other CpHMD methods aim to introduce an additional parameter into MD simulations which is the pH. The introduction of the pH relates to the fact that the standard MD protocols assume fixed protonation states in their residues whereas, in biological conditions, residue titration is dependent on the pH and the surrounding environment. While there are many valid ways to integrate the chemical potential within MD, in this work we use a start-stop approach to change the protonation state along the simulation partitioned into three main steps:

- a Poisson-Boltzmann/Monte Carlo (PB/MC) step ;
- a solvent relaxation step ;
- a MD production step ;

in the PB/MC, protonation free energies are calculated in a single conformation to determine the likelihood of the different protonation states of a titrable site, which are then sampled through a MC procedure until it satisfies a criterion. Upon reassigning the protonation state, a short MD is run with restraints on the solute to allow the solvent to readjust to the new charges. Finally, there is the production MD step, typically 20 ps, which samples the conformational space. After this step, we reinitiate the cycle for how many times are necessary until we reach the desired simulation length. A deeper dive on how we can extract energies from protonation-dependent properties will be addressed on the analysis segment.This method effectively couples discrete protonation states and conformational sampling, thus allowing a more rich description of a biological system.

### Metadynamics integration:

In typical metadynamics simulations, specific degree of freedoms are selected as fundamental for a given biological system. Hence, we accelerate the conformational sampling of the system in function of those degree of freedom called collective variables (CV) by periodically building an history-dependent bias potential. This bias potential is generated by summing Gaussians along the simulation in the CV space. For more details, check the theory behind the [PLUMED tutorial](https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.9/user-doc/html/advanced-methods.html) on metadynamics.

Effectively, certain degrees of freedom are more challenging to sample and can relate to important conformational properties of the system of interest. Furthermore, these degrees of freedom may be regulated by key pH-sensitive residues or certain conformational ensembles require major conformational transitions triggered by changes in the electrostatic environment. These slow degrees of freedom benefit from enhanced sampling techniques such as metadynamics but also from a CpHMD method that easily changes the protonation state of key residues. This is done by allowing the PLUMED module to be ran in the MD production step of the st-CpHMD method following a pre-defined PLUMED input file with chosen CVs. We will explore how to define these settings in the following section. By integrating PLUMED within the st-CpHMD methodology, we effectively improve the accuracy of average protonation and pKa calculations as the tutorial will show in later sections.

## Setting up a CpH-Metadynamics simulation

Setting up a CpH-Metadynamics simulation requires defining parameters for two sections: the CpHMD section and the PLUMED input file. Previous knowledge on [metadynamics](https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.9/user-doc/html/advanced-methods.html) and/or CpHMD simulations is helpful.
Examine the CpHMD.settings file. For now, let's observe the main defining settings:

```
###  Start of CpHMD settings (pHmdp) ###
#
########################################
export SysName="A5mer" # Name of our protein or system
export Segments=100 # Number of MD/CpHMD Segments
export Seg_size=10 # Size of each Segment in nanoseconds
export ffDIR="/leonardo/home/userexternal/tfernand/Constant_pH/CpHMD_MetaD/top/XOL3pH.ff"
export ffID=XOL3pH #XOL3pH # Force fields: G54a7pH/CHARMM36pH  --> GROMOS 54a7/CHARMM 36m
export plumed=grid # Static - static potential after metaD ; grid - run metaD using grids instead of running Hills; yes - standard metaD using Hills
export water=opc # Water model used
export pH=XX.XX # Solution pH
export sites="9" # list of residues to titrate or "all" to titrate every residue
export temp=300.0 # Temperature (Kelvin)
export ionicstr=0.01 # Ionic Strength (moles/litre)

```

In this section, we need to define the number of segments and the size of each segment in nanoseconds. In the following exercise, we will manage 100 ns trajectories partitioned into 10 segments of 10 ns each. Another important input is the choice of force field. Popular force fields were specifically modified to incorporate multiple protonation tautomers for different biomolecules (see: [CpHMD-v3.0 Github page](https://github.com/NunoFBOliveira/CpHMD_v3/tree/main)). In this tutorial, we will be studying a uridine nucleobase, so we will use the XOL3pH ff (see the [XOL3pH parametrization](https://github.com/Tomfersil/CpH-MetaD/tree/main/CpHMD_metaD/top/XOL3pH.ff)).

Then it is possible to choose either to perform a plain CpHMD simulation or choose different options for a metadynamic simulation:

- plumed=yes: performs a metadynamics simulation reading from the HILLS every cycle;
- plumed=grid: stores both a GRID and HILLS file. Restarting a segment reads from the GRIDS file. Recommended setting due to speed;
- plumed=static: performs a static potential simulation by reading a previous HILLS file. No more gaussians are added and continues to explore the CV space.

The sites entry is needed to define the titrable sites based on the residue numbering in the .pdb file used as input. It accepts either a number or the all flag. Finally, we need to set system parameters such as the simulation temperature, the pH and the ionic strength (in mol/L) for the PB calculations. FOr more details on the CpHMD settings, check the work done by the Machuqueiro Lab in the previously linked GitHub pages.

Concerning the specific parameters for the metadynamics section, either check the end of the file or the template PLUMED_GRID.dat file. We recommend this setting since it provides a greater advantage in I/O speed compared to the HILLS file.


```

# Define the biasfactor for the well-tempered. This is an important parameter.
# Define the temperature. It should match the chosen temperature in the CpHMD settings.
# Define the minimum and maximum of the GRID range and the stride at which it is written.
# With these settings, we are reading and writting over the same grid file every N steps. This is computationally lighter and faster to use.  
metad: METAD ARG=chi,puck.Zx PACE=500 HEIGHT=2.0 SIGMA=0.35,0.35 BIASFACTOR=4 TEMP=300 FILE=HILLS GRID_MIN=-pi,-pi GRID_MAX=pi,pi GRID_WSTRIDE=500 GRID_WFILE=GRID GRID_RFILE=GRID 
   
# Print both collective variables on COLVAR file every colvar_stride steps (Xps)
PRINT ARG=chi,puck.Zx,metad.bias  STRIDE=1000 FILE=COLVAR 
```
The main argument is the METAD command. Using the ARG keyword we need to specify the variables concerning our CVs upon the metadynamics bias will be added. In the uridine system that we are studying, it will be the $\chi$ angle and ribose puckering. Then we need to define, for both CVs, the HEIGHT of the Gaussians in kJ/mol, the width of the Gaussians defined by keyword SIGMA, and the PACE (frequency in number of time steps) at which Gaussian are added. The biasfactor and the temp are important parameters since they will define the convergence of the initial barrier height scaling. The defined parameters are standard for a nucleoside simulation using these specific CVs.

Concerning the GRIDS, the bias potential is also written to a GRID file (GRID_WFILE keyword) and then read (GRID_RFILE keyword) on the following cycle. The grid boundaries are defined by GRID_MIN and GRID_MAX, while the frequency of update is done every GRID_WSTRIDE time steps (it should match the PACE).

After carefully choosing the PLUMED.dat parameters and the CpHMD settings, a CpH-Metadynamics simulation can be run. To run a CpH-MetaD simulation, there are available scripts and template settings files in the following path of the [CpH-MetaD GitHub page](https://github.com/Tomfersil/CpH-MetaD/blob/main/CpHMD_metaD/scripts/). These simulations will generate several files:

Simulation/Input data: 
- GRID: the GRID file that is necessary to restart each cycle and segment of the CpH-MetaD. Do not erase between segments;
- HILLS: the accumulated bias potential of each segment ;
- .pHmdp: the general settings for each specific segment ;
- .gro: the last frame of each .xtc segment is stored as a reference to start the following segment ;

Output data:
- .occ: these files have the protonation data stored. Later we will examine them; 
- .mocc: average occupancy of each titrable site;
- .xtc: the MD trajectory of each segment is stored as an .xtc file ;

Simulation information data:
- .log.gz: log file of the simulation ;
- .err.gz: other data concerning GROMACS, PB and MC log information; 
- .info: these files store general information of the cycles performed in each segment;



# Analyzing CpH-Metadynamics simulations

In this tutorial, we will briefly look into different analyses that can be performed using CpH-MetaD. These analysis will be comprised of two parts:

- Conformational analysis
- Protonation analysis

In the conformational analysis, we will evaluate the convergence of chosen Collective Variables (CV's), characterize the CV space and estimate errors. In the protonation analysis, we will estimate average protonations of the titrable site at each pH value, estimate pKas using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and calculate errors, while using the metadynamics weights. Furthermore, we will compute the same properties using a WHAM procedure to reweight to obtain smoother and more accurate descriptions of several observables.

# Conformational Analysis

## Extraction of trajectories and protonation state data

All trajectories and protonation states were extracted locally using the scripts in the data folder. Take notice of them and examine how to extract the information.

## Calculating populations and the free energy in function of the CVs 

Here we use the PLUMED tool to obtain reweighted data on the desired observables, i.e. the chosen CV's: 
- the $\chi$ angle of titrable site : this important property of nucleobases characterizes the relative orientation of the base/sugar. It is defined by the O4'-C1'-N1'-C2 (C,U) or O4'-C1'-N9-C4 (A,G). When the angle is between 0 and 2 radians (-90Âº to 90Âº) it is in syn and the base is oriented towards the sugar, while from -pi to 0 and 2 to pi the angle is in anti. This base-flipping is a slow internal degree of freedom therefore a good candidate for a CV. It is also useful to validate our force field against experimental data;

- the sugar puckering: another slow yet important property that refers to the conformation of the ribose. It is defined by the C2' and C3' atoms' relative positions to the plane defined by the C1', O4' and C4' atoms. The C2' endo is defined by the C2' atom above the plane and similarly the C3' endo for the C3' atom. The positioning defines the proximity of the 2'-OH group to the base and also the helix type. These calculations were done locally. 

Biased simulations were performed at 3 distinct pH values: 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0. Since the pKa of uridine is 9.22, then each simulation should exhibit differences in their observables if they are protonation-dependent. And that is what we are going to assess. For that purpose, we need to unbias our simulations and obtain either the weights or the unbiased observables. First, we need to extract the reweighted observables using the HILLS file for each simulation of our system. To do that we need to run the PLUMED driver module on the concatenated trajectory using a modified version of our PLUMED.dat input file. Examine the following cell that generates the PLUMED_rew.dat file. 

```
%%bash
    # Define system name
    sys=U1mer
    # Iterate through each simulation pH
    for pH in 09.00 09.25 09.50
    do
    #Generate a new PLUMED file for each pH
    cat > plumed_rew_${pH}.dat << EOF
    
    # Provide molecular information given the system pdb
    MOLINFO STRUCTURE=data/${sys}.pdb
    # Define the atoms for the chi torsion angle CV
    chi:  TORSION ATOMS=8,9,19,28
    # Define the atoms for the sugar puckering CV
    puck: PUCKERING ATOMS=6,8,9,13,11
        
    # Activate well-tempered metadynamics module using the defined CVs. For the sugar puckering, we want specifically the Zx vector.
    # The PACE is defined to a very large number and the Height to 0.0 kJ/mol because we do not want to add new gaussians.
    # The RESTART=YES to restart the metadynamics, hence read the added Gaussians from the provided HILLS file.
    # The bias factor, GRID boundaries are equal to the ones provided in the simulation.
    metad: METAD ARG=chi,puck.Zx PACE=100000000 HEIGHT=0.0 BIASFACTOR=8 SIGMA=0.35,0.35 FILE=data/HILLS_pH${pH} GRID_MIN=-pi,-pi GRID_MAX=pi,pi RESTART=YES # <- this is the new stuff! 
    
    # Using the REWEIGHT_BIAS, we provided the metad.bias as an argument to obtain the weights.
    as: REWEIGHT_BIAS ARG=metad.bias

    # Unbiased histograms for the observables are obtained by providing the logweights previously defined.

    hhpuck: HISTOGRAM ARG=puck.Zx STRIDE=1 GRID_MIN=-pi GRID_MAX=pi GRID_BIN=100 BANDWIDTH=0.1 LOGWEIGHTS=as 
    # Then we can convert the histograms h(s) to free energies F(s) = -kBT * log(h(s))
    # by using the CONVERT_TO_FES module and then dump the free energies.
    ffchi: CONVERT_TO_FES GRID=hhchi 
    ffpuck: CONVERT_TO_FES GRID=hhpuck 
    # Print out the free energies F(s) 
    DUMPGRID GRID=ffchi FILE=ffchi_${pH}.dat 
    DUMPGRID GRID=ffpuck FILE=ffpuck_${pH}.dat 

# Print to a COLVAR file the chi angle, the Zx component of the sugar puckering and the metad.bias
PRINT ARG=chi,puck.Zx,metad.bias FILE=COLVAR_REWEIGHT_${pH} STRIDE=1 
EOF

# Then we run the plumed driver tool using the following command for each pH simulation. We also define the value of KBT in energy units.
plumed driver --mf_xtc data/${sys}_pH${pH}.xtc --plumed plumed_rew_${pH}.dat --kt 2.5
done

```

From the previous cell, we were able to obtain the weighted histograms, the unweighted properties and the bias used along the frames of the simulation. At this moment, we can extract the information from the COLVAR files and compute the weights w of each frame using w = exp(V/kBT) and then applying each w to each value of the observable. As such, we can obtain weighted averages, free-energy differences between the energy minima and plot the free energy along the chosen observable. 

In the following cells, we will examine how the pH impacts the CVs of our system by comparing the populations of the syn/anti and the C2'/C3' endo conformations and their free energy differences. 

### Q1. Does increasing the pH, thus the number of deprotonation events, impact the thermodynamic balance between these distinct conformations? 

```
KbT = 2.5
pH_values = ['08.00','09.00','10.00']
for pH in pH_values:
    
    # Load the FES file and the COLVAR file.
    ffChi   = np.loadtxt("ffchi_"+str(pH)+".dat")
    Chi     = np.loadtxt("COLVAR_REWEIGHT_"+str(pH))
    
    # Extract the information into distinct columns: Time, Chi, Puck, metad.bias
    col = pd.read_csv('COLVAR_REWEIGHT_'+str(pH), sep=" ", header=None, skiprows=range(0,3),usecols=[1,2,3,4],names=["Time", "Chi", "Puck", "metad.bias"])
    # Define the maximum value of the bias. This will provide a better numerical approximation.
    maxim=np.max(col['metad.bias']) 
    # Define the weight for each frame as defined by w=exp(V(s)/kBT).
    weights=np.exp((col['metad.bias']-maxim)/KbT)
    # Then normalize the weights
    weights=weights/np.sum(weights)
    # Add a new columnd with the weights to our dataframe.
    col['weight']=weights

    sweights = []
    aweights = []

    # Split the weight between syn (0<= syn <=2) and anti according to the Chi values.
    for index in range(0,len(col)):
        cval = col['Chi'][index]
        wval = col['weight'][index]
        if 0 <= float(cval) <= 2:            
            sweights.append(wval)
        else:
            aweights.append(wval)
    
    # Then we each population average as the sum the normalized weights
    smean  = np.sum(sweights)
    amean = np.sum(aweights)
    # Through the relation of Fi = - KbT ln(1/N Sum(x)), we know the free energy of a minimum
    # Then the free energy difference can be given by deltaF_{x-y} = - KbT ln(meanX/meanY) 
    # Since the difference of the logs is equal to the log of the quotient, we assume KbT = 1 in this case
    fed = -np.log(smean/amean)*KbT

    # Then we can print the free energy difference between the two populations and their average value for chosen property (Chi angle)
    #### Exercise: Try to print the population values of both states at the different pH values:
    #HIDDEN
    print("The free energy difference, at pH {}, (syn to anti) on the Chi angle CV is {:.3f} KJ/mol and the syn pop is {:.3f}".format(pH,fed,smean))
    #ENDHIDDEN

    #### Exercise: Try to plot the free energy in function of the $\chi$ angle CV  at the different pH values:
    # We can also plot the data as degrees instead of radians by converting rad*180/pi
#HIDDEN
    plt.plot(ffChi[:,0]*180/np.pi,ffChi[:,1],label="pH"+str(pH),linewidth=2)
    plt.title("Chi Angle")
    plt.xlabel("Chi CV")
    plt.ylabel("free energy [kJ/mol]")
    plt.legend(ncol=1)
plt.show()
#ENDHIDDEN
```

### Q2. Calculate the By observing the plot and examining the populations' values, what can we learn from the pH dependence of this system?
